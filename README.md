**An ongoing effort in compatibility for small mods and Artisanal Reskins**
This mod serves as the central location to unify and harmonize one-off mods or compatibility issues that players may experience with the Artisanal Reskins suite of mods.

If there is a mod that is unsupported by Artisanal Reskins and you would like it to be, please make a thread on the discussion tab.

If you are a mod author and want to support Artisanal Reskins, and find yourself in the position of wanting to add this mod as a dependency, please **stop** and talk to me.

**Updates**
This mod is constantly being worked on, but I am a graduate student and school has resumed. Regular content updates will be released monthly, and critical bugfixes will be released on an as-needed basis.

**Localization**
You are welcome to help with localization, please use [this Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/factorio-mods-localization). You can find more details [here](https://github.com/dima74/factorio-mods-localization#how-to-translate-using-crowdin). Locale updates will be released on the weekend they are received from Crowdin.
