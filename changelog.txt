    - Internal code revisions such that reskinning is trigger-based
    - Added a symbol to Mini Machines icons to distinguish them from their normal-sized counterparts
    - Improved support for Circuit Processing with proper color alignment; note that this is a work-in-progress and sprites are preliminary pending a more detailed pass, and rich text for the setting description is incomplete
